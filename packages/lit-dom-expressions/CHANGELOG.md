## 0.50.0-next.4

## 0.50.0-next.3

### Patch Changes

- 4dae801: Normalize the `repository` field in every package to the standard npm
  convention: a `git+https://github.com/ryansolid/dom-expressions.git` URL
  with a `directory` pointing at the package within the monorepo. Restores
  "View source" / "Open in repo" links on the npm registry and unblocks
  tooling that resolves source from package metadata.

## 0.50.0-next.2

### Patch Changes

- 39c207c: Fix a SyntaxError when an element has 222+ merged dynamic attributes
  (solidjs/solid#2682). The internal identifier generator produced `in` at
  index 221, and since these identifiers are emitted as object shorthand
  destructuring bindings, the resulting `({ …, in }) => …` could not be parsed.
  `getNumberedId` now shifts past any natural index that would encode to a JS
  reserved word, keeping the mapping injective and the output at 2 characters
  for all practical dynamic counts.
- 305d9ce: - SSR: Duplicate attributes in JSX without spreads are now deduplicated —
  `<div class="a" class="b" />` correctly renders as `<div class="b" />`
  (last-wins), matching client behavior. Previously the compiler kept both
  attributes in the output.
  - Client: `setAttributeNS` / `removeAttributeNS` now use matching names when
    clearing namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`). Previously removal could
    leave the attribute in place because it used the local name while the set
    used the qualified name.
  - Expanded test coverage across all four packages; no other behavior changes.

## 0.50.0-next.1

### Patch Changes

- ee365e0: - `insert()` accepts an optional 5th `options` argument that is forwarded to the
  internal `effect()` call, letting callers (e.g. Solid's `render()`) opt into
  transition-aware initial mounts without otherwise changing `insert`'s
  behavior.
  - SSR: `$dflj(ids)` now materializes every id in the list in a single call
    instead of stopping after the first successful `$dfl`. Callers pass only the
    keys they intend to materialize, which simplifies the primitive and composes
    cleanly for bulk-uncollapse cases (e.g. a group activation revealing several
    held fallbacks at once).
  - SSR: Fix cascading async root holes in the streaming shell. When an inner
    Loading boundary resolved its first chunk while the outer shell was still
    pending, `flushEnd` could call `serializer.flush()` before `doShell()` had
    written the root `_assets` module map, causing seroval to silently drop the
    writes and client hydration to fail with "module was not preloaded". Root
    asset serialization is now memoized and gated on both paths.
  - Type formatting cleanup in `jsx-properties.d.ts`.
