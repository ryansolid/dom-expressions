## 0.50.0-next.4

## 0.50.0-next.3

### Patch Changes

- 4dae801: Normalize the `repository` field in every package to the standard npm
  convention: a `git+https://github.com/ryansolid/dom-expressions.git` URL
  with a `directory` pointing at the package within the monorepo. Restores
  "View source" / "Open in repo" links on the npm registry and unblocks
  tooling that resolves source from package metadata.
- 1cc342c: Unify the compiler's void-element list with the runtime's `VoidElements` set in `dom-expressions/src/constants`. The compiler previously kept its own array (`src/VoidElements.ts`) that still contained the long-deprecated `keygen` and `menuitem` tags. Both have been removed from the HTML standard and are no longer parsed as void by modern browsers, so the compiler now emits closing tags for them — which is the correct behaviour in current browsers and was a latent bug otherwise. All other void elements are unaffected.

## 0.50.0-next.2

### Patch Changes

- 4d14c82: Fix single-dynamic attribute accessors being silently invoked with the
  previous value. Given `<div style={source()} />`, the compiler previously
  emitted `effect(source, (v, p) => style(el, v, p))`, which causes the
  reactive core to call `source(p)` — leaking `prev` into a user-authored
  accessor that the source expression wrote as a zero-arg call. Polymorphic
  accessors (e.g. atom-style signals) would observe an unexpected argument
  and misbehave.

  The compute position now emits `() => source()` so the user's call shape
  is preserved. The prior optimization of unwrapping an IIFE
  (`(() => x)()` → `() => x`) is retained since IIFEs are zero-arg and
  cannot leak `prev`.

  Fixes #510.

- 39c207c: Fix a SyntaxError when an element has 222+ merged dynamic attributes
  (solidjs/solid#2682). The internal identifier generator produced `in` at
  index 221, and since these identifiers are emitted as object shorthand
  destructuring bindings, the resulting `({ …, in }) => …` could not be parsed.
  `getNumberedId` now shifts past any natural index that would encode to a JS
  reserved word, keeping the mapping injective and the output at 2 characters
  for all practical dynamic counts.
- 03da8a5: Fix SSR escaping gaps reachable from JSX, and tighten the compiler so
  redundant runtime `escape` calls drop out of the output.

  Security fixes:
  - `ssrStyle` and `ssrClassName` now attribute-escape object keys, not
    just values. Previously a user-controlled key in `<div style={{…}} />`
    or `<div class={{…}} />` could break out of the surrounding attribute.
  - Dynamic fragment-child expressions (`<>{state.text}</>`) now compile
    to `_$memo(() => _$escape(expr))`. Element-child expressions already
    escaped via `escapeExpression`; fragment children reached SSR through
    a separate path and were concatenated raw.
  - Computed-key object styles (`style={{ [k]: v }}`) escape the key at
    compile time.

  Compiler alignment:
  - SSR now matches DOM in rejecting fragments placed directly inside an
    element: `<div><>…</></div>` is a compile error in both renderers.
    Fragments reached via conditionals (`<div>{cond && <>…</>}</div>`)
    remain legal.

  Compiler optimizations:
  - `escapeExpression` drops the outer `_$escape` wrap on a `JSXFragment`
    when its single significant child is either a dynamic expression
    (compiles to a memoized accessor function, `escape(fn)` is a no-op)
    or a native element (compiles to an `_$ssr(…)` SSR node object,
    `escape(object)` is a no-op). This turns
    `cond && _$escape(_$memo(() => _$escape(state.text)))` into
    `cond && _$memo(() => _$escape(state.text))`, and
    `cond && _$escape(_$ssr(_tmpl$N))` into `cond && _$ssr(_tmpl$N)`.

  SSR fixtures for `components`, `conditionalExpressions`, `fragments`,
  and `attributeExpressions` regenerate. Each security fix has a JSX
  round-trip test in `packages/dom-expressions/test/ssr/jsx.spec.jsx`
  that feeds hostile input through `renderToString`.

- 305d9ce: - SSR: Duplicate attributes in JSX without spreads are now deduplicated —
  `<div class="a" class="b" />` correctly renders as `<div class="b" />`
  (last-wins), matching client behavior. Previously the compiler kept both
  attributes in the output.
  - Client: `setAttributeNS` / `removeAttributeNS` now use matching names when
    clearing namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`). Previously removal could
    leave the attribute in place because it used the local name while the set
    used the qualified name.
  - Expanded test coverage across all four packages; no other behavior changes.

## 0.50.0-next.1

### Patch Changes

- ee365e0: - `insert()` accepts an optional 5th `options` argument that is forwarded to the
  internal `effect()` call, letting callers (e.g. Solid's `render()`) opt into
  transition-aware initial mounts without otherwise changing `insert`'s
  behavior.
  - SSR: `$dflj(ids)` now materializes every id in the list in a single call
    instead of stopping after the first successful `$dfl`. Callers pass only the
    keys they intend to materialize, which simplifies the primitive and composes
    cleanly for bulk-uncollapse cases (e.g. a group activation revealing several
    held fallbacks at once).
  - SSR: Fix cascading async root holes in the streaming shell. When an inner
    Loading boundary resolved its first chunk while the outer shell was still
    pending, `flushEnd` could call `serializer.flush()` before `doShell()` had
    written the root `_assets` module map, causing seroval to silently drop the
    writes and client hydration to fail with "module was not preloaded". Root
    asset serialization is now memoized and gated on both paths.
  - Type formatting cleanup in `jsx-properties.d.ts`.
